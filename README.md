## Introduction
### Goal
The goal of the project is to compare recipes from two popular recipe websites, Spoonacular and Food.com, and identify "healthy" recipes using two market-implemented measures:
1. Nutri-Scores: [https://www.mangiu.ch/index/](https://www.mangiu.ch/index/)
2. Weight Watchers (WW) Smart Points [https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/how-it-works/smartpoints](https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/how-it-works/smartpoints)

The project will investigate recipe popularity, meal types, and cuisines.

### Repository Structure

### Dataset
- `RAW_interactions.csv` and `RAW_recipes.csv` from [Kaggle - Food.com Recipes and Interactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?)
- [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

## Scope
### Research Questions
1.	Are more popular / higher-rated recipes healthier? What is the health rating of the highest-rated recipes?
2.	What meal type (i.e., breakfast, lunch, or dinner) have the healthiest/unhealthiest (percentage) recipes? What is the most popular ingredient for each meal?
3.	Which cuisine has the healthiest recipes?

### Nutritional Values
THe nutritional values of interest will be reduced to the minimum required for calculating the "health" score: `calories`, `saturated fat`, `sugar`, and `protein`.

### Meal Types
Meal types will be narrowed down to `breakfast`, `lunch`, and `dinner`, or equivalents if unavailable.

## Approach
### Data Analytics Paradigm
1. Decompose the Ask + Identify Data Sources
    - The first two steps were conducted simultaneously in the project proposal phase.
    - The research questions and data sources are provided in [Scope]

2. Define Strategy and Metrics

3. Build a Data Retrieval Plan

4. Retrieve the Data

5. Assemble and Clean

6. Analyse or Trends

7. Acknowledge Limitations

8. Tell the Story

#### Food.com

## Decision Points
1. Food.com - meal types - `dinner` is not a tag, use `dinner-party` instead.
2. 

## Analysis

### Results

### Limitations


## Future Research
