## Introduction
### Goal
The goal of the project is to compare recipes from two popular recipe websites, Spoonacular and Food.com, and identify "healthy" recipes using two market-implemented measures:
1. Nutri-Scores: [https://www.mangiu.ch/index/](https://www.mangiu.ch/index/)
2. Weight Watchers (WW) Smart Points [https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/how-it-works/smartpoints](https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/how-it-works/smartpoints)

The project will investigate recipe popularity, meal types, and cuisines.

### Repository Structure

### Dataset
- `RAW_interactions.csv` and `RAW_recipes.csv` from [Kaggle - Food.com Recipes and Interactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?)
- [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

## Approach
Followed the Data Analytics Paradigm

### Decompose the Ask + Identify Data Sources
The first two steps were conducted simultaneously in the project proposal phase

### Define Strategy and Metrics


### Build a Data Retrieval Plan


### Retrieve the Data


### Assemble and Clean
